⦁	 Windows 2000/NT/Xp/Vista
⦁	 RAM: 256 MB or more
⦁	 HARD DISK 40 GB or more Processor P3 or High Compiler Standard C Compiler

Functional Requirements:

Non- Functional Requirement:
⦁	The system must verify and validate all user input and users must be notified in case of errors detected in the course of using the system.
⦁	A system should have a high performance and reliability level.


Limitations
It is not cloud based database Management system, therefore it limits other users from interacting with it. The user is to ensure separate information backup reason that we use Microsoft access to develop the system which cannot support the system to be used on other operating system like Linux and apple.
