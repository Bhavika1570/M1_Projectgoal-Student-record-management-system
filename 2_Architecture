In the Student Record Mnagement System,  system design, source code, programme testing, and added many additional functions  to help the user the most.
In this miniproject user can enter the Student's record and verify that the user has all of the necessary information.
The systems efficeincy:
Less human error 
Strength and strain of registers and papers can be reduced 
High security 
Data consistency  
Easy to handle 
Easy data updating  
Easy record keeping 
Backup data can be easily generated
Student record management system in C language is made by using three or more than three header files or many data types such as:
1. #include<stdio.h> : this header file will contain Scanf() , Printf () And, there are many header files which are used in this program.
2. #include<conio.h>: this header file will contain Clrscr(); , Getch(); . 
3.#include<string.h> : this header file will contain string function. 
4.#include<stdlib.h> : this header defines four variable types, several macros, and various functions for performing general functions.
5.#include<windows.h>: this header file is used to access the Win32 API functions and it makes it easier for the user to use the in-built functionality.
